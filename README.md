# Co.P.P.S. Discovery
### A system for discovering Correlations between Pathologies and Pollution Sources.

CoPPS Discovery lets you manage worldwide informations about Diagnoses, Pathologies and Pollution Sources using a spatial database, then it helps you find a correlation between them.

Developed with [@latios93](https://github.com/latios93). Technologies used:
* PHP 7 (backend)
* HTML5 + Bootstrap + JQuery and Ajax (frontend)
* PostgreSQL + PostGIS (spatial database)
* Google Map

You can try our service [**HERE**](https://copps.informatica-unina.com/) using the guest/guest credentials (sorry, we cannot let anyone vandalize the database).

This software is currently used as an example to teach spatial databases at *Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli Federico II*, so we can't release the source code at the moment; we plan to release it in the future.
